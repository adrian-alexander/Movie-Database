Project: Movie Database
Made by: Adrian Alexander, 101150602

Business logic code:
logic.js
 - contains business logic for registering a user, logging in a user, a user's watchlist, and a user's 
 favorite movie. I haven't implemented watchlist and favourite movie yet, as I haven't quite figured out how I want to do that yet.

Stuff to install:

npm install express


How to setup, run, and test server:
	Extract to a folder
	Open cmd, cd to that folder
	type 'node server.js' to test server
